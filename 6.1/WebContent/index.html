                        <p>
                            Mason is a young university that, in just a short time, has made impressive strides in size, stature and influence. Today,
                            as Virginiaâ€™s largest public research university, we are setting the benchmark for a bold, progressive
                            education that serves the needs of our students and communities. To that end, we have
                            <a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/academics#tab_Schools">10 schools and colleges </a> devoted to
                            a variety of areas of study.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mason has three campuses in Fairfax, Arlington and Prince William Counties in Virginia and an international campus in Songdo,
                            Korea. In addition, Mason operates a site in Loudoun County and has partnered with the Smithsonian
                            Institution to offer a global conservation studies program at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology
                            Institute in Front Royal, Virginia.

                        <p>
                            More than 30 years ago, when George Mason University founded what would become the Volgenau School of Engineering, the Apple
                            Macintosh was a year old, the Sony Discman was the latest in portable music, and VHS was state-of-the-art
                            for home theater equipment. Cell phones were the size of bound books and heavier than bricks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The world is a different place than it was at our founding in 1985, and so is the school. We have changed our name, lived
                            in three different buildings, and added classrooms, labs, students, and faculty. Our programs
                            have expanded and evolved to match the ever-changing demands for engineering, computer science,
                            and information technology.

                            <p>
                                Computer Science is a discipline concerned with the design, implementation, and maintenance of the computer software systems
                                used in almost all other professions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Minor in Computer Science is intended for those pursuing other undergraduate degree programs who feel the need to pursue
                                Computer Science to complement their other studies. Regardless of their discipline, undergraduates
                                find a knowledge of Computer Science to be helpful in today's world. This Minor is not a
                                "computer literacy" program; all the courses are the same as taken by Computer Science majors.

                                must complete at least <b>6 credits</b> in their minor at
                                Mason and achieve a <b>minimum 2.00 GPA</b> in courses applied to the minor. No more than

                            <h3>Computer Science, MS</h3>
                            <p>
                                The MS in Computer Science prepares students for research and professional practice in computer science and related technologies.
                                The program includes both fundamentals and advanced work in the areas of artificial intelligence
                                and databases, programming languages and software engineering, systems and networks, theoretical
                                computer science, and visual computing.Graduate classes are generally offered in the late
                                afternoon and evening. Financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships may be available
                                for full-time degree-seeking students.
                            </p>

                                Students are required to complete <b>30 credits</b> corresponding to <b>10 graduate courses</b>.
                                Courses are divided into basic courses,which have no graduate course prerequisite, and advanced
                                courses, which have a graduate course as a prerequisite.
                            </p>

                            GMU is an excellent place to pursue a PhD in computer science. We have a world-class faculty with research expertise in a
                            diverse set of computer science areas and our program is nationally ranked. Additionally, George
                            Mason University is located in the center of one of the largest computer science and information
                            technology corridors in the nation, and is in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., a major center
                            for science and engineering research and funding. This makes the area a rich source for PhD research
                            opportunities. Our PhD graduates have been highly successful both in academic and industrial
                            positions.
